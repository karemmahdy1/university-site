        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Cook Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 12
            ounces of spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions
            until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare Sauce: In a bowl, whisk together 3 large egg yolks, 1 whole
            egg, 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of black pepper.
            Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook Pancetta: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook 8 ounces of
            diced pancetta until it's crispy and the fat is rendered, about 5-7
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine Ingredients: Reduce the heat to low and add the cooked
            spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to combine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add Sauce: Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour in the
            egg and cheese mixture, tossing the pasta continuously to create a
            creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved
            pasta water a little at a time until you reach the desired
            consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve: Serve immediately, garnished with extra Parmesan cheese and
            freshly ground black pepper.

          soy-garlic sauce. Perfect for a healthy and satisfying weeknight
          dinner, this stir-fry is a feast for the eyes and the taste buds.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Prepare Tofu: Press 1 block (14 oz) of extra-firm tofu to remove
            excess moisture. Cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook Tofu: In a large skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of
            vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes and cook
            until golden and crispy on all sides, about 7-10 minutes. Remove
            from the skillet and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare Vegetables: While the tofu is cooking, chop 1 red bell
            pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, 1 zucchini, 1 carrot, and 1 cup of
            broccoli florets. Mince 3 garlic cloves and 1-inch piece of ginger.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 2
            tablespoons of hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar, and 1
            teaspoon of cornstarch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook Vegetables: In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of
            vegetable oil if needed. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until
            fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chopped vegetables and stir-fry
            for 5-7 minutes, or until tender-crisp.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine and Serve: Return the tofu to the skillet and pour the sauce
            over the stir-fry. Toss to coat everything evenly and cook for
            another 2 minutes until the sauce thickens. Serve immediately,
            garnished with sesame seeds and chopped green onions if desired.
